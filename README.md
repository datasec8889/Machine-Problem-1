1. Define an R function that removes NA values from a vector.
2. Define an R function that computes the factorial of given an integer argument. The output should be a vector of length 1.
3. Define an R function that computes the determinant of a given matrix. The output should be a vector of length 1. (use basic r and operations)
4. Define an R function that sorts a given vector in decreasing order. The output should be a vector of the same length. It should accept both numeric or character vectors.
5. Define an R function that accepts a POSIXct as argument and outputs the day of the week as characters. (Donâ€™t use special functions. Instead use modulo and define weekdays)
6. Create a function to return the nth highest number
